## About

Imagine a platform where millions of transactions happen every day, with products of various types being ordered and delivered in just a few minutes. What might the dashboard of such a company look like?

This dashboard focuses on Blinkit's daily business operations. It is fully dynamic and consists of three main sections: Sales Overview, Customer Overview, and Feedback Overview.

The dashboard provides insights into the company's performance compared to the previous year. It highlights key metrics such as the most frequently used payment methods, the customer segments that contributed the most orders during the financial year, the areas generating the highest revenue, the products in greatest demand, and many other business-related insights.

The customer section is equally interesting. It helps the company to understand customers purchasing habits. 
The graph shows number of customers ordering on days of a week in every month. And the tile slicer next to the graph helps to filter customers in various types - Premium, Regular, Inactive, New.

The dashboard categorizes products into different types for better comprehension. Each icon functions as a button, and when clicked, it updates the entire dashboard based on the selected product. In the following image the black circle around the icon shows that it is selected.

In the Feedback section, ratings are displayed with emojis, making it more visually appealing and easy to understand. The dashboard is fully dynamic, as the emojis in the black section are interactive. Users can click on them to view detailed information about the number of people who gave that rating and their feedback on the company's services.
